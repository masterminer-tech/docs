`Masterminer team would like to remind you that by purchasing shares in a Masternode, you are putting trust into the 3rd party service. Please do your due diligence before participating.`



## Masternode Pooling
Masterminer acts as a mediator to crowdsource the collateral requirements to operate a SYS masternode. Once masternode is operational - rewards will be divided among pool shares owner proportional to shares percentage owned. Masternode pooling enables investors to participate in cryptocurrency mining systems without risking investing a large initial capital.
